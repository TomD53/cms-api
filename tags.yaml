      In order to access protected resources, you must have an access token

      
      To gain an access token, you must first be registered as a user. Only admins
      are capable of creating new users, so you need to ask an admin.


      Once you are registered as a user, you will have a username and a password. You
      can use this username and password to fetch a token which you can use to authorise
      future requests.


      To fetch an access token, make a `POST` request to the route `/oauth2/token`. 
      The request body should be of content-type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and 
      should contain a `username` and a `password`


      If your credentials are correct, the server will respond with a `Token` object:

      ```

      {
        "access_token": YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN, 
        "token_type": "bearer"
      }

      ```

      Once you have obtained this token, you can authenticate requests with it by adding 
      the `Authorization` header. The content of this header should be as follows:
      ```
      Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
      ```
